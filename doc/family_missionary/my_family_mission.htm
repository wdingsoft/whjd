	<li>One night early in Jan of 2022, I had a dream: two coffins laid down in front of me on my way. &quot;Open it otherwise you are not permitted to pass through&quot; Being scared, I opened the left one and saw a face that I am very familiar with. But I could not remember his name no matter how hard I recalled.</li>
	<li>On Janunary 15 soon after I arrived in Atlanta, I suddenly got a shocking call from Beijing China--my father passed away. The ambulance insisted on me speaking in the phone that my father was dead when they arrived. I had to agree with them otherwise they could not go.</li>
	<li>I visited to them between Dec 2019 and Feb 2020. At time, I did not know it would be the last time I ever met him face to face. I wish I could receive my parents to live with us as soon as the pandemic is over. They are around 90 yeas old. But my wish is a wish of man. Now I have to go to take care of my mom: it started a journey of my personal family missonary, which turned to be an adventure in my life.</li>
	<li>family missionary is a mission impossible: A good solution is to give your family to the Church while you serve the Church: To let the Church finish his work.</li>
	<li>I am the only Chirsitian in my family.</li>
	<li>family brief.</li>
	<li>a Sinful Family.</li>
	<li>a sinful family under cultrual revolutionary re-education.</li>

<h5>application of the visa to China.</h5>

<ol>
	<li>At that time in China, Beijing held the World Winter Olympic Game. The pandemic is severe in China. The sino-usa relationship is the lowest point. The China consulates had policy: unless it&#39;s necessary and emergency, the application of visa would not be permitted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I applied the visa with reasons necessary and emergent. After two weeks, I got approved.</li>
	<li>I flew to Seattle 15 days ahead of the trip to China.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All flights were locked down. I had to fly to Shanghai first.</li>
	<li>I was quaritined in Shanghai for twe weeks and spend 700 dollars (Rmb 500 per day with free meals).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The policy to Beijing: two weeks mandatory quaritine plus one week self-quaritine. (14+7)</li>
	<li>I was kicked out in the self-quaritine in Shanghai. We were allowed to find a hotel ourselves. The regular hotel is not allowed to live for allient.</li>

<ol>
	<li>Shanghai:&nbsp;devil capital.<br />
	well-treatment for 14 days quarantine with 500rmb/day.<br />
	During the +7-isolation obversation, I was arranged in capital of monster. But all were kicked out in the second day. Saying they recieved an order from upper commanders, the hotel must be empty. (later i knew that it is prepared for pendemic breaking out.)<br />
	Where can I go? (lesson: do not count on the gov)<br />
	(1) regular hotel did not accept me because of the allient.<br />
	(2) Found a star level hotel that could accept&nbsp;foriengers but not support isolation observation function, the price is above 1000rmb/day, I also need to take bus for nucli acid test daily.<br />
	(3) Talked with a friend Li Dong, who find a member who can&nbsp;provide his home for&nbsp;me.<br />
	(4) Took subway to HongQian Railway Station. Met a young lady (employee in the&nbsp;station) who led me to the ticket selling gate and window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	(5) Ticket officer: Do you have greencode of health kits. Can I buy one to&nbsp;Xinji?<br />
	(6) while waiting in the hall, I chatted with a guy who took the same train at 10am. &quot;Have you heard of Jesus Christ?&quot; &quot;Yes, it belongs to religous groups. I do not want to approach them.&quot; Why?&quot; &quot;&nbsp;it is forbidden&nbsp;in public,&nbsp;why do you get troublesome? I can behavior well myself.&quot;<br />

	(2) I was led into a isolated room to wait for the abmulance to be sent to Fangcang Quarintine Center. where I was isolated for 14 days.&nbsp;<br />
	(3) better than Shanghai:&nbsp;not luxuary but simple and clean witout smell. hygen food. the room and board is free.&nbsp;<br />
	(4) In the last day, I was told to be sent to hopital for a routine check before I was discharged.<br />
	(5) This time, my cell is indeed a real prison rather than quaritine room.<br />
	(6) conversation with Jiang.&nbsp;<br />
	(7) Following Jiang&#39;s words, I came to railway station, I could not buy ticket because I do not have nucli acid test report. I call Fangcang to get a paper report, but they told me to test my self at hospital. I can buy a ticket to ChengDe where I can buy a ticket to BJ.&nbsp;<br />
